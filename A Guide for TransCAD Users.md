# A Guide for TransCAD Users

## Introduction

This guide is provided for users who are not familiar with the commercial transportation planning software [TransCAD](https://www.caliper.com/tcovu.htm) but wish to get access to the traffic assignment dataset we presented through this software. The software version we used in this guide is 9.0 and the detailed authorization information is shown below.

## View the dataset

The traffic assignment results of TransCAD are stored in the folder corresponding to each city with a file named ‘02 TransCAD results’. We take the city of San Francisco as an example, and here below are all the results obtained from the TransCAD.

## Input data

Node data, link data, and OD data are the three main input data for traffic assignment, here we give a brief demonstration about how to view these data in TransCAD respectively.

First of all, open the software and click the open file button.

Then, navigate to the storage location of the dataset on your computer, and open the file with the ‘.dbd’ extension. It is a file format used by TransCAD to store the road network geographic information.

Then the visualization of a city’s road network would be displayed in TransCAD as below.

### Node data

Open the node layer in the ‘Display Manager’ box by clicking the green check box and activate it in the working layer box.

Below is the corresponding node attribute table and each row records a node's information.

As shown in the dataview table above, the fields with a green background are automatically generated by TransCAD when importing the data, while the fields with a light-colored background contain information from the initially imported data. A detailed description of each node filed is provided below.

- ID: ID generated automatically by TransCAD
- Longitude: Longitude generated automatically by TransCAD
- Latitude: Longitude generated automatically by TransCAD
- Elevation:	Longitude generated automatically by TransCAD
- Node_ID:	Original ID information
- Lon:	Original Longitude information
- Lat: Original Latitude information
- Tract_Node: A binary variable indicating whether a node is a Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ) or not
